In August 2019, FireEye released a report on APT41, a China-nexus group targeting industries such as gaming, healthcare, and telecommunications. APT41 adapts quickly and often utilizes recently-disclosed vulnerabilities.

In April 2019, suspicious activity was identified on a U.S.-based research university's web server. The attackers were exploiting CVE-2019-3396, a vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server.

The attackers used a template from GitHub to issue arbitrary commands against the vulnerable system. They downloaded a file identified as a variant of a China Chopper webshell.

Shortly after, two additional files were downloaded: 64.dat and Ins64.exe, used to deploy the HIGHNOON backdoor. The attackers utilized both the web shell and the backdoor to issue commands.

The attacker also downloaded a script from PowerSploit, a PowerShell Post-Exploitation Framework. They later downloaded two more files, c64.exe and F64.data, components of a malware family known as ACEHASH.

Key Takeaways: APT41 utilized multiple malware families. Effective detection requires coverage of both Endpoint and Network. Patching of critical vulnerabilities is crucial.
